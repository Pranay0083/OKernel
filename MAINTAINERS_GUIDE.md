# OKernel Maintainer's Guide 🛠️

So, you want to change the version number or update the configuration? You've come to the right place.

## 1. Dynamic Configuration (App Version)
We no longer hardcode versions in `package.json` or React components for display purposes. The standard source of truth is **Supabase**.

### How to update the App Version:
1.  Go to your Supabase Dashboard -> **SQL Editor**.
2.  Run the following query:
    ```sql
    UPDATE app_config 
    SET value = 'v0.5.0' 
    WHERE key = 'app_version';
    ```
3.  **That's it.** The application (Home, Navbar, Footer, Admin Console) will instantly reflect the new version on the next refresh.

### Other Config Keys:
| Key | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `app_version` | The display version string | `v0.4.0` |
| `system_status` | Global system status label | `ONLINE`, `MAINTENANCE` |
| `motd` | Message of the day (Admin Console) | `System stable.` |

## 2. Admin Console Features
The Admin Console (`/admin`) is a separate, isolated environment.

*   **Featured Reviews**: To change the order of reviews on the homepage, go to **/admin/featured** and drag-and-drop the items. This updates their `rank` in the DB.
*   **SQL Console**: Use **/admin/sql** to run raw queries. **WARNING**: This bypasses some client-side guards. Use with caution. 
    *   *Note: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `BEGIN` are not supported in the mocked RPC environment.*

## 3. Project Structure
*   `src/syscore/`: The heart of the simulation (CPU, Scheduler, Algorithms).
*   `src/pages/admin/`: All admin-related components (Inbox, SQL Editor, etc).
*   `sql/`: All database migration and setup scripts.

## 4. Releasing
When ready to release:
1.  Update `app_version` in Supabase (see Step 1).
2.  Update `src/pages/Changelog.tsx` to add the new release notes.
3.  Commit and Push.
